When it comes to using a backup to save your storage from being erased from off the face of the earth, you can never go wrong when using any type of storage.
Today I am going to talk to you about a simple way to use a backup and I am sure we have used it before but we may know someone who has never heard of it and the good news is that it is easy to use and that is using a USB Flash Drive to hold all your information.
This can be used in the following easy steps.
1. Buy a USB hard drive that can store numerous amounts of data.  It doesn't have to be anything too large but I would reccomend using the same storage amount that your computer has as well.
2. Plug in the USB to the laptop or computer that you are using and make copies of all files contained (or the ones that you want to save for sure) and save it to the USB.
3. Remove USB and go to another computer and check to see to see if all of the data that you copied is now in the USB (This is to ensure that everything was transfered over successfully).
4. That's it! Enjoy the extra amount of sleep that you will get knowing that all of your important data will be securely be backed up.
